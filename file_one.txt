learn git from sratch 

C:\Users\pavan\OneDrive\Desktop\GIT_learn>git status
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git


git init 
Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/pavan/OneDrive/Desktop/GIT_learn/.git/


git status
On branch master
No commits yet
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        file_one.txt
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)


first check  git status on CMD after creating folder file_one.txt 
we will get fatal error: not a git repository 

so  how to make it repository ?
 run git init 

it will Initialize empty git repository in the path C:/Users/pavan/OneDrive/Desktop/GIT_learn/.git/



After check again the status 
it will show as follow
On branch master
No commits yet
ntracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        file_one.txt
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

so it is asking to Commit means asking to add to staging area 

we can directly commit using Commit option or use CMD git add <file_name> (it will not show any thing) 

Again check the status Add status 
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   file_one.txt


 now need use command  git commit -m "added first file" 
  C:\Users\pavan\OneDrive\Desktop\GIT_learn>git commit -m "added first file" 
  [master (root-commit) 3e40a00] added first file
 1 file changed, 54 insertions(+)
